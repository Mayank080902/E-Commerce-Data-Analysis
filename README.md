# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis
Setup and Execution (Using Google Colab)
To reproduce the analysis and results, you only need a Google account.

1. Access the Notebook and Data
  a. Open the Notebook: Click on the E_COMMERCE_DATA_ANALYSIS.ipynb file in this repository and select "Open in Colab".

  b. Upload the Data: Since the notebook reads a local file path (/content/ecommerce_dataset_updated.csv), you must upload the dataset:

    i. In the Colab notebook, click the folder icon on the left sidebar (File Browser).

    ii. Click "Upload to session storage" and select the ecommerce_dataset_updated.csv file from your computer.

2. Run the Analysis
The notebook already includes the code to install necessary Python packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).

  a. Click "Runtime" in the top menu, then select "Run all".

  b. The notebook will execute the data loading, cleaning, RFM analysis, and generate all charts and supporting outputs.

  c. The outputs are used directly to create the final Analysis Report.

ðŸ’¡ Key Analytical Focus
The analysis centered on three main areas:

  a. Customer Segmentation: Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics to identify high-value customer groups.

  b. Sales Performance: Measuring revenue and discount impact per product category.

  c. Temporal Analysis: Discovering peak and slow periods by month and day of the week.
